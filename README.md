### Hi there I'm Andres

#### I am a student at the University of Georgia (UGA) studying Computer Science.

#### I am also the current Team Lead for the Flight Software Team at UGA's [Small Satellite Research Lab](http://smallsat.uga.edu/) (SSRL)
---
I am currently learning about deep learning in addition to all the embedded software and flight software I'm learning
and researching about at the SSRL.
I am also looking to collab on any cool projects or any deep learning research or any flight software.
